This game is a mix of survival/roguelike/puzzle genre, where you play as a AI in the shape of a doctor. Like any AI, you are not fault-free and something could break. Your goal is to not be caught by any patient by fixing bugs or faults in your system.

It's a game made for a gamejam, the ZENOJAM7 (https://itch.io/jam/zeno-jam-7)

You can find some sneak peek at the end of this readme, but the game is still in development
